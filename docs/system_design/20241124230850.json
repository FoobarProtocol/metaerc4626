{"Implementation approach":"We will leverage OpenZeppelin's Solidity libraries to implement the ERC4626-compliant vault with a vesting schedule. The key challenges include implementing accurate vesting calculations and ensuring secure access control. OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`, `Ownable`, and `AccessControl` will be used for security and administrative functions. A separate Vesting contract will handle custom vesting logic, and interfaces will be defined for both the Vault and Vesting contracts to ensure modularity and ease of testing.","File list":["contracts/Vault.sol","contracts/Vesting.sol","contracts/interfaces/IVault.sol","contracts/interfaces/IVesting.sol","test/VaultTest.sol","test/VestingTest.sol","migrations/1_deploy_contracts.js","app.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Vault {\n        +deposit(amount: uint256) void\n        +withdraw(amount: uint256) void\n        +getBalance(address: address) uint256\n        +getVestingSchedule(address: address) VestingSchedule\n        +pause() void\n        +unpause() void\n        -calculateShares(amount: uint256) uint256\n        -calculateAssets(shares: uint256) uint256\n    }\n    class Vesting {\n        +calculateVestedAmount(address: address) uint256\n        +calculateUnvestedAmount(address: address) uint256\n        +updateVestingParameters(duration: uint256, intervals: uint256) void\n        -linearVestingCalculation(startTime: uint256, cliff: uint256, duration: uint256) uint256\n    }\n    class IVault {\n        +deposit(amount: uint256) void\n        +withdraw(amount: uint256) void\n        +getBalance(address: address) uint256\n        +getVestingSchedule(address: address) VestingSchedule\n    }\n    class IVesting {\n        +calculateVestedAmount(address: address) uint256\n        +calculateUnvestedAmount(address: address) uint256\n    }\n    Vault --> IVault\n    Vesting --> IVesting\n    Vault --> Vesting\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant V as Vault\n    participant VE as Vesting\n    U->>V: deposit(amount)\n    V->>VE: calculateVestedAmount(address)\n    VE-->>V: vestedAmount\n    V-->>U: confirmation\n    U->>V: withdraw(amount)\n    V->>VE: calculateUnvestedAmount(address)\n    VE-->>V: unvestedAmount\n    V-->>U: tokensReleased\n    U->>V: getBalance(address)\n    V-->>U: balance\n    U->>V: getVestingSchedule(address)\n    V-->>U: vestingSchedule\n    Admin->>V: pause()\n    V-->>Admin: confirmation\n    Admin->>V: unpause()\n    V-->>Admin: confirmation\n    Admin->>VE: updateVestingParameters(duration, intervals)\n    VE-->>Admin: confirmation\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on specific user interface requirements and whether there are additional features beyond the core vesting and vault functionalities."}
